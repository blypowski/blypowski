My name is Jakub Marczyk, I am a Computer Science student at Uniwersytet Jagiello≈Ñski (and a graduate of Architecture at Politechnika Krakowska).  
I'm currently looking for an internship as a Java Software Developer.  
I'm willing to learn Spring Boot framework or get hands-on professional experience in Java, or to learn JavaScript and C# programming languages from the scratch.
