My name is Jakub Marczyk, I am an Architecture graduate at Politechnika Krakowska and a Computer Science student at Uniwersytet Jagiello≈Ñski.
I'm currently looking for an internship as a Java Software Developer.
I'm willing to learn Spring Boot framework or get hands-on professional experience in Java, or to learn JavaScript and C# programming languages from the scratch.
