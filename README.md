My name is Jakub Marczyk, I am a Computer Science student at Jagiellonian University and a graduate of Architecture at Cracow University of Technology.
I have successfully completed university courses, obtaining experience in C/C++, Java (with Spring Boot/Hibernate) and Python languages.
I'm currently looking for an internship in the fields of Software Development or Machine Learning/Data Science.  
I'm open to learning new technologies, especially JavaScript with Angular as a front end.
